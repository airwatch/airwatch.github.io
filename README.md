## Introduction

Worldwide ambient air pollution accounts for:

* **29%** of all deaths and disease from lung cancer
* **17%** of all deaths and disease from acute lower respiratory infection
* **24%** of all deaths from stroke
* **25%** of all deaths and disease from ischaemic heart disease
* **43%** of all deaths and disease from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Pollutants with the strongest evidence for public health concern, include particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Also, particulate matter of less than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter (namely PM10 and PM2.5) are capable of penetrating deep into lung passageways and entering the bloodstream causing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory impacts.
With Airwatch, you can see the impact how big events impact air quality
We believe Airwatch will raise awareness about timelocal
