## Introduction

As winter approaches, air pollution in China worsens as energy use, in its case being coal, soars.

Three decades of swift economic development has turned China into the world’s second largest economy and lifted more than 500 million Chinese people out of poverty. However, the country’s economic development goes hand in hand with environmental woes.

China now has one of the worst air quality in the world, according to Aaron van Donkelaar, an air pollution researcher at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. "Human activity plays a large role," he said.

The country of nearly 1.4 billion people is seeing a surge in cancer cases, with lung cancer patients being as young as 8 years old, even though the smoking rate is on a decline. China’s air pollution is no longer its own issue: the smog has crossed the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, polluting South Korea and Japan.
