# AIR WATCH

https://airwatch.github.io

## Introduction

Worldwide ambient air pollution accounts for:

* **29%** of all deaths and disease from lung cancer
* **17%** of all deaths and disease from acute lower respiratory infection
* **24%** of all deaths from stroke
* **25%** of all deaths and disease from ischaemic heart disease
* **43%** of all deaths and disease from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Big events can be a major threats for health bringing more people and more pollution in the same place quickly.
This impacts both locals and events participants. 

With Airwatch, you can see how big events impact air quality.
We believe Airwatch will raise awareness about pollution during big events.

Based on the air quality open data from [openaq](https://openaq.org), we are able to get pollution stats .

For historical events, we use cold storage from S3. For current and future events, we can use the openaq real time API. 

## 3 huge events are given as example around the world
